.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is a secure and authenticated store for secrets (passwords,
keys, certificates) and small documents.
It uses
.Em envelope encryption
with one-time password (OTP) authentication.
The vault can be operated as a file system in userspace.
.\" -----
.Sh OPTIONS
The general options are:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Fl c | Fl Fl ciphers
List the available ciphers.
.It Fl d | Fl Fl datapath Ar path
Base path to the vault data.
.It Fl h | Fl Fl help
Show the application help text.
.It Fl l | Fl Fl log-level Ar level
Set the log level:
.Cm DEBUG ,
.Cm INFO ,
.Cm WARNING ,
.Cm ERROR ,
.Cm CRITICAL .
.Pp
The levels are case insensitive.
.It Fl s , Fl Fl server Ar url
Authentication server address.
.It Fl v , Fl Fl version
Print version information and quit.
.El
.\" -----
.Sh COMMANDS
The first argument,
.Ar command ,
specifies the action to take.
Available commands are:
.Bl -tag -width create -offset 3n
.It Ic create Oo Fl c Ar cipher Oc Oo Fl m Ar mac Oc Oo Fl n Oc Oo Fl h Oc Ar uid
Create a new vault with the given UID.
.Bl -tag -width xxxxxxxxx -compact -offset 3n
.It Fl c | Fl Fl cipher Ar cipher
Cipher to be used for encryption.
.It Fl m | Fl Fl mac Ar mac
MAC algorithm to use for composite AE scheme.
.It Fl n | Fl Fl noauth
No authentication.
WARNING: Such use case is very significantly less secure.
.It Fl h
Show help of this command.
.El
.\" ---
.It Ic export-key
Print the metadata and the effective encryption key.
This command can be used to backup the key and relevant metadata
for recovery purposes.
WARNING: Leaking this key would compromise the data, therefore expose it
with caution.
.Pp
This data can later be typed into a file and vault recovered using the
.Ic mount
command with the
.Fl r
flag.
The recovery data must be typed back exactly as it was printed.
.\" ---
.It Ic ls Oo Fl a Oc Oo Fl h Oc Op path
List the vault contents.
.Bl -tag -width xxxxxxxxx -compact -offset 3n
.It Fl a | Fl Fl all
Show all files and directories, including the files beginning with dot.
.It Fl h
Show help of this command.
.El
.\" ---
.It Ic sdb
Enter the command line interface (CLI) to operate the database of secrets
(e.g. passwords).
The following inner commands are available within the CLI:
.Bl -tag -width xxxxxxxxx -offset 3n
.It Cm LS
List secrets.
.It Cm GET Ar name
Get the secret value.
.It Cm SET Ar name
Set the secret value.
.It Cm DEL Ar name
Delete the secret.
.El
.Pp
The given names must not have white spaces.
The secret will be asked in a prompt.
.\" ---
.It Ic mount Oo Fl c Ar 1|0 Oc Oo Fl d Oc Oo Fl f Oc Oo Fl r Ar path Oc Oo Fl s Ar mode Oc Oo Fl h Oc Ar path
Mount the vault as a FUSE file system at the given path.
.Bl -tag -width xxxxxxxxx -compact -offset 3n
.It Fl c | Fl Fl compress Ar 1|0
Enable or disable (default) compression.
.It Fl d | Fl Fl debug
Enable FUSE-level debug logging.
.It Fl f | Fl Fl foreground
Run in the foreground, i.e. do not daemonize.
.It Fl r | Fl Fl recover Ar path
Mount the vault using the recovery file.
.It Fl s | Fl Fl sync Ar mode
Sync mode on write operations:
.Cm weak
(faster, but less durable/safe) or
.Cm full
(default).
.It Fl h
Show help of this command.
.El
.\" ---
.It Ic read Ar path
Read and decrypt the file in the vault.
.\" ---
.It Ic write Ar path
Encrypt and write the file into the vault
.El
.Pp
All paths for these commands must represent the namespace of vault.
.\" -----
.Sh DATA AUTHENTICATION
Authenticated encryption (AE) is used for the file data and metadata,
including the file and directory names.
.Pp
The file system tree as a whole, however, is not authenticated.
This is something to be aware of if the encrypted data would be stored
externally (e.g. as a backup).
Future versions of
.Nm
might provide a solution for this with snapshot or backup functionality.
.\" -----
.Sh ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
The following environment variables are available:
.Bl -tag -width xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
.It Ev RVAULT_PATH
Base path of the vault data.
.It Ev RVAULT_SERVER
Authentication server address.
.It Ev RVAULT_CLI_TIMEOUT
Inactivity timeout (in seconds since the last command entry) after which
the CLI will automatically exit.
Default: 600.
.El
.\" -----
.Sh FILES
The following files reside in the directory specified by
.Ev RVAULT_PATH :
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx -compact
.It Pa rvault.error_log
error log (use for troubleshooting)
.It Pa rvault.metadata
vault information/metadata file
.It Pa rvault.sdb
secret database (used by the
.Ic sdb
command)
.It Pa rvault.pid
PID of the
.Nm
FUSE daemon
.El
.\" -----
.Sh EXAMPLES
An example how to initialize and mount a new vault:
